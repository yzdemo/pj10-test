# Date of Retrospective: 01/23/25
* Led by: Nataly Gonzalez
* Present: Lucy, Saeed, Matthew, Tim, Wilson, Rocky, Nataly
* Absent: n/a

## Action items
1. Start communicating more frequently - Communication is key for discussing merging, working collaboratively in pairs or groups, updating team of ongoing progress.
2. Our group has done very well with following our team norms and agreements and will continue to follow them.
3. Stop being vague - In order to have a better understanding of what our project is doing, having specificity during daily scrums and in the PR descriptions becomes really helpful when reviewing what is needed.
4. Continue working diligently on sub-issues - Breaking down larger tasks into smaller progress points helps team make progress and not 'get swamped' with last minute (merge) conflicts and bugs. 

## Optional - Additional discussion points:
1. Lucy
- Stop merging directly to main
- Continue working on sub issues

2. Tim
- Easier to combine
- Stop describing work broadly - need specifics of the tasks to understand what is going on
- Do research for features (individually)

3. Wilson
- Start working on sub issues
- Stop giving bad empty PRs
- Continue going to class and communicating

4. Matthew
- Time management, in person meeting (pairs/mob)
- Stop having to worry about assignments due previously (check in at before daily scrums)
- Continue norms and agreements: showing up on time, responsive, communication

5. Rocky
- Start more group chat communication
- Agreed with previous stated points of other team members

6. Saeed
- Start issues early
- Communicate about PRs
- No proscrastinating
- Communication with team (e.g. merging)

## Experiment/Change

A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
- One change we want to do is having more specificity of in our PRs and daily scrums.
- We are giving really broad points of our progress and sometimes it is hard to understand what one team member is talking about.
  
A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
- We expect to see results in PR descriptions and team discussions. (Before experiment happens)
- Results: There was some improvement in the specificity in (mostly) our PRs, and the daily scrums. It was easier to understand the progress of the project at the current moment by explaining each of our parts, making the integration of them easier to conduct. Although there is still for improvement, it seems that our group is heading in the right direction. 
  
A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
- Decision: TBD in next retro

## Retro Assessment

A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
- Used the start/stop/continue format: everyone thought about 3-5 points for discussion, and then team discussed about their thoughts on each point mentioned by the team member.

A brief assessment of how it went.
- Everyone actively participated by actively listening to each other and commenting on each other.
- Respectful conversations, no interruptions (talking over each other). Everyone had designated time to voice their own points without interruptions.
  
What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
- Consistently ask for how the group wants to tackle the retro before starting.
- Give ample time to each team member to give their own points/comments.
- Try to initiate discussion on the points just given by a team member - hard to make everyone comment on them, but at least trying to spark a lengthier discussion.
