Hi, my name is Lucy Deng, and I am a third year computer science student. I like dogs very much.  
**Idea**:  
My idea(for general logistics) is to create an web application which user will input the pdf/doc of their syllabus, and parse(still brainstorming how to parse), then show the calenders of deadlines on google doc.
