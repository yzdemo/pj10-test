## About Me
I am a third year Computer Science major. I am proficient in C++, Python, Javascript and React.

## Project Ideas
**My goal is to build a product that facilitates the use of time management tools and encourages organization.**

Many students (like myself) use Google Calendar to track their courses and assignment deadlines. However, the manual transfer of this information is tedious and time consuming. Thus, _automating_ this process to schedule these dates and only validating correctness reduces the time spent on individually adding this information for multiple courses to just a few minutes.

### Features to implement
- **File uploading**: Implementing a file uploader that validates the files added (file size, max number of files, file type); drag-and-drop zone for quick addition of syllabi

- **File validation**: Choosing the restrictions for files, such as maximum number of files that can be added, file size and type, for better error handling.

- **User interface**: Finding the best way to create a straightforward, easy-to-read interface for users to easily use the web app to receive the final product.
