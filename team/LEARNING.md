# Learning Plan

Gain knowledge of usage and applications of the following:

- unpdf (https://www.npmjs.com/package/unpdf)
- Natural lib (https://naturalnode.github.io/natural/) NLP + other libraries for comparison
- Uploading PDF (and other files), accessing from back-end 
- UI + UX
- Next.js
- Vercel
- Gemini API
- Google Calendar API

## Commitments

- Matthew will learn how to use Gemini API for week 3, and pair with Saeed for week 4 event extraction since he has more experience with training models.
- Lucy will research NLP model training during week 3, and pair with Saeed for week 4 event extraction since he has more experience with training models.
- Wilson will look into importing into Google Calendar in week 3. He will work Matthew & Lucy during week 4 to guide them through improving generated CSVs with Google Calendar as he will be more familiar with the importing process.
- Rocky will continue to learn how to use various UI tools during week 3. During week 4, he will experiment with different designs to make website navigation more convenient and accessible.
- Nataly will look into importing non-PDF files and integrating file importation with front-end during week 3. She will work with Rocky during week 4 to guide the integration with the front page as she will be more familiar with its intricacies to make it more compatible.
- Timothy will continue researching methods and principles to reduce NLP model errors during week 3 and 4.
- Saeed will research front-end design through UI tools such as Figma during week 3. He and Rocky will pair during week 4 to share their findings and learn from one another to improve the design and layout of the front page.
